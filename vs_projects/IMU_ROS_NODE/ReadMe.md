## Introduction

**ðŸŽ¯ Real-Time 3D Pose Tracking with ROS2 & RViz**

Ever wondered how robots, drones, and VR headsets know exactly how they're oriented in 3D space? This project brings that same cutting-edge technology to life through a complete hardware-software pipeline that transforms raw sensor data into stunning real-time 3D visualizations!

**The Magic Behind the Motion:**
- **ðŸ§  Smart Sensor Fusion**: Harnessing the power of the MPU9250 9-axis IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) to capture every twist, turn, and tilt
- **âš¡ Real-Time Processing**: An ATMEGA-328P microcontroller acts as the bridge, translating sensor data over I2C and streaming it via USB-UART
- **ðŸŽ¨ 3D Visualization**: ROS2 nodes seamlessly process the data stream, feeding RViz's powerful visualization engine to create immersive 3D pose tracking

*Watch as raw sensor data transforms into smooth, accurate 3D pose estimation in real-timeâ€”the same technology powering autonomous vehicles and advanced robotics systems.*
